Create an API for a phonebook application using ExpressJS.

The application should be able to handle several CRUD Operations.



The User/Client/Front End should be to GET all people in the phonebook database
The User should be able to GET a single person by ID
The User should be able to create a new person in the database with a name, phoneNumber, picture, and an ID generated on the backend.
Bonus 1: The user should be able to delete a person from the phonebook database.
Bonus 2: The user should be able to edit a person in the database (Change the name, picture or the phoneNumber)
Bonus 3: Add a middleware that checks if the phoneNumber has exactly 6 characters. If it does it should let the request move on to the next middleware. If not, it should respond with an appropriate message.
